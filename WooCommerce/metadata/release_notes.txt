We’re thrilled to announce that it’s now possible to edit an order from the app. Right now, you can edit or remove products, fees, shipping and change product quantity. We’ve also added an option to search for customers when creating or editing an order.

In order details, some third-party extensions were not logically showing order metadata. We’ve made some changes to display these custom fields for an order. We’ve also made several improvements to our payments and login flow, including the option to install Jetpack directly from the app.

Please continue to send us feedback – we are listening!
